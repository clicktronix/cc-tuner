# cc-tuner plugin

Skills that tune Claude Code's own configuration. One install, no per-project copies to drift.

## Skills

### `claude-md-writer`

Create, refactor, and audit **CLAUDE.md** and **`.claude/rules/`** memory files for Claude Code, following the official memory docs (<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory>). Triggers when you create/trim/split a CLAUDE.md, organize instructions into `.claude/rules/`, or decide what belongs in CLAUDE.md vs rules vs `CLAUDE.local.md` vs tool config.

What it covers (Claude Code memory facts checked against the docs):

- **CLAUDE.md < 200 lines** — the only published size target; loads every session.
- **`paths:` frontmatter only on `.claude/rules/*.md`**, never on CLAUDE.md (CLAUDE.md loads by directory hierarchy; conditional loading is a rules-file feature).
- **Documented load order** — managed → user → project → local; files are concatenated, not overriding, and conflicts are resolved arbitrarily (so the fix is to remove conflicts, not lean on precedence). Rules and subdirectory CLAUDE.md are separate mechanisms, not precedence tiers.
- **Code style / conventions belong in CLAUDE.md** (the docs' own example is "use 2-space indent"); only hard *blocks* go to hooks/settings.
- Correct details on **imports** (max 4 hops), **auto memory** (`MEMORY.md`, first 200 lines / 25 KB, machine-local), **path-scoped rules** (trigger on read; user-level rules *do* load), **monorepo** (`claudeMdExcludes`), and **HTML-comment stripping**.

Deep examples and the verified source list are in the skill's `reference.md`.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add clicktronix/cc-tuner
/plugin install cc-tuner@cc-tuner
```

The skill is model-invoked: Claude loads it when your task is about a CLAUDE.md or `.claude/rules/` file (activation is driven by the task and the skill's description, not by file reads). No slash command needed.

## Scope

Claude Code only. It writes Claude Code's memory surfaces (CLAUDE.md, `.claude/rules/`, `CLAUDE.local.md`) — it does not manage other agents' instruction files.
